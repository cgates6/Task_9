This function is able to add consecutive numbers together that are in a vector. So, if you don't want to manually add up all the numbers from 1 to 625, this function will do it for you.
```{R}
library(addition)
```
```{R}
additionloop <- function(x){
  n<-(length(x))
  output <-0
  for(i in 1:n){
    output <- output+x[i]
  }
  return(output)
}

#This function should return the same output as the sum() function:

additionloop(1:625)
```
